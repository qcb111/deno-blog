《最坚固的战船》  
精神鼓起来，掌舵追寻荣耀
出海为元老院再立新功劳
海军和海兵，伏波军的骄傲
哪有人比水兵本领更高超！  
（副歌：
最得意的水兵
最坚固的战船
我们时刻就绪，稳住，嘿，稳住！
我们出征战斗，凯旋又凯旋！）  
不是我们没把敌人歼灭到
只因敌人看见我们就逃跑
若是有种就来大洋过过招
不要每次都被直追到岸礁  
不管敌人如何凶恶又残暴
海军战士永远不会被吓倒
任凭敌人海里东漂又西绕
他们面前总有水兵准备好  
敌人见了我们就害怕逃跑
我们追击敌人到天涯海角
高歌一曲  我们得胜还朝
歌唱海军战士，人民和元老


Come, cheer up, my lads, 'tis to glory we steer,
To add something more to this wonderful year;
To honour we call you, as freemen not slaves,
For who are so free as the sons of the waves?  
Chorus:
Heart of Oak are our ships,
Jolly Tars are our men,
We always are ready: Steady, boys, Steady!
We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again.  
We ne'er see the French but we wish them to stay,
They never see us but they wish us away;
If they run, why we follow, and run them ashore,
For if they won't fight us, what can we do more?  
(Chorus)  
They say they'll invade us these terrible foe,
They frighten our women, our children, our beaus,
But if should their flat-bottoms, in darkness set oar,
Still Britons they'll find to receive them on shore.  
(Chorus)  
We still make them feel and we still make them flee,
And drub them ashore as we drub them at sea,
Then cheer up me lads with one heart let us sing,
Our soldiers and sailors, our statesmen and king.  
(Chorus X2)
