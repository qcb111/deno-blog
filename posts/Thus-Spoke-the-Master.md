## *Thus Spoke the Master* translated by X. Y. Z.

子曰：巧言令色，鲜仁矣。（学而第一）

2. An intelligentleman, said the Master, eats to live, and not lives to eat. He may dwell in comfort, but not seek comfort in dwelling. He should be prompt in action and cautious in speech. He should seek good company and amend his faults. Such a man may be said to be good at learing.

子曰：君子食无求饱，居无求安，敏于事而慎于言，就有道而正焉，可谓好学也已。

3. I care less, said the Master, to be understood and recognized by other people than to understand and recognize others.

子曰：不患人之不己知，患不知人也。

4. An intelligentleman, said the Master, is not a mere implement.

子曰：君子不器。（为政第二）

5. To learn without thinking, said the Master, risks to be blind, while to think without learning risks to be impractical.

子曰：学而不思则罔，思而不学则殆。

6. When Duke Ai asked Zai Wo what symbol was used in the altar, Zai Wo replied, “The Xia rulers used the pine, the Yin rulers used the cypress, and the Zhou rulers used the chestnut, which means to chase the people off the nut.” Hearing of this, the Master said, “What is done cannot be undone; what is accomplished need not to be criticized; what is bygone need not to be blamed.”

哀公问社于宰我。宰我对曰：“夏后氏以松，殷人以柏，周人以栗，曰使民战栗。”子闻之，曰：“成事不说，遂事不谏，既往不咎。”（八佾第三）

7. A cultured man cares for what is proper and fit while an uncultured man cares for the profit.

君子喻于义，小人喻于利。（里仁第四）

8. Master Zeng said, “An intellectual should be strong and steady, for his duty is heavy and his journey will be long. Is it not a heavy duty to be a man of men? Is his journey not long which will not end until his death?”

曾子曰：“士不可以不弘毅，任重而道远。仁以为己任，不亦重乎？死而后已，不亦远乎？”（泰伯第八）

9. Do not interfere, said the Master, into the matter you are not in a position to.

子曰：“不在其位，不谋其政。”（泰伯第八）

10. I have never seen a man, said the Master, who loves his duty more than beauty.

子曰：“吾未见好德如好色者也。”（子罕第九）

11. Zi Lu passed one night at the Stone Gate. Next morning the gate keeper asked him where he came from. He said, “From Confucius.” The gate keeper said, “Is it the man who would try the impossible?”

子路宿于石门。晨门曰：“奚自？”子路曰：“自孔氏”。曰：“是知其不可而为之者与？”（宪问第十四）

12. A yesman, said the Master, is a thief of virtue.

子曰：“乡愿，德之贼也。”（阳货第十七）
